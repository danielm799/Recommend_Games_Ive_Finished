# I need classes for both titles and graphs. A title object needs to point to
#it's relevant genres and it needs to possess its own name. A genre object
#would need to point to their relevant title objects, add a title object, and print
#out its own name and their relevant titles. I think doing this properly is gonna need a 
#dictionary of titles with their genres as keys, so maybe it isn't necessary to make titles
#point to other titles if theyre going to be on the list
#but whats getting to me is that there must only be one title and one genre. THe only things that
#should be in multiples are the connections e.g. its a graph. But that means that genre objects cannot just
#make a new title if that title maybe exists.

#somehow make a for loop that takes every title's list of relevant genres to make an edge 
#between the title and the relevant genres, or make a function do it

#also set up a linked list that connects titles to each other as to prevent the need of making a list of titles.
#saves memory 

#now ask the user if they want to search through titles or by genre

#if statement for their choice and then ask for a few characters that hopefully match something in this program

#if title, set pointers at the head and tail node to hopefully speed up the search for a relevant title. Relevant 
#titles will be added to a list (the object themselves). The list is produced and I somehow need to proint out the
#string Titles and their Genre lists.

#its easier with Genres. I just use a bunch of if statements and do something similar with Titles like adding 
#relevant genres to a list and printing them out in the end, but I'll be printing out the edges too.
