# Recommend_Games_Ive_Finished
this is another project I am doing for CodeAcademy and I will be using this for my portfolio too.
Today I learned how horrible I am with source control. It took 30 minutes to figure out why changes I was making in VS was going to another repository and why a new repository wasnt made (silly of me I know).
This project is meant to ask the user to search through a data set I will make that contains games I have played and completed. Nothing fancy.
